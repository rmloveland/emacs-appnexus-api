* TODO Figure out how to log current user for future use

  In order to do this we'll have to keep track of the current user
  somehow. Perhaps in the buffer name?

* TODO Merge together P{UT,OST} calls with payloads for file saves?

* TODO Fix buffer names of `who-am-i' and friends that aren't updated yet

* TODO Store past values of `path-and-params' for smart completion

* TODO Write CLOS/EIEIO accessors for API response objects

  This applies to `anx-docgen' as well.

* TODO Update functions with comments describing their contracts

* TODO Update function docstrings

* TODO Implement a save function

  This will save the buffer as its current name, so that (for example)
  a buffer named http://sand.api.appnexus.com/member/meta.el will save
  under that name (perhaps with a timestamp?).

* TODO Reporting download

  Automate this multi-step process...

* TODO Abstract HTTP calls in a macro

* TODO Write a Texinfo manual

* DONE Implement HTTP DELETE calls

* DONE Do some general refactoring

* DONE Denote internal-only functions

  I like jao's method using `--'. See the Geiser source code for examples.

* DONE Write a commentary in the source code
